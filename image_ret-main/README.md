## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/)
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rapido_image_ret.git
   cd rapido_image_ret/src
   ```
   

2. 
    ```
    pip install hatch
    ```

3. 
    ```
    hatch env create
    hatch shell
    ```

4.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

The main script `index_and_retrieve.py` supports two tasks: **index** and **search**.

### Step 1: Index Images

Before searching, you need to build an index of your image database. Run the script with `task = "index"` to convert images and create the index:

```
python index_and_retrieve.py
```
